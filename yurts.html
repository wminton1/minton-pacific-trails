                        <dt>What is a Yurt?</dt>
                        <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures 
                            four feet off the ground. Each yurt has canvas 
                            walls, a wooden floor, a roof dome that can be 
                            opened, and a private deck.</dd>
                        <dt>How are the Yurts Furnished?</dt>
                        <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a gas fireplace, 
                            king-size bed with down quilt, comfy couch, dining 
                            table and chairs, mini-fridge, microwave, and coffee 
                            maker. Your luxury camping experience includes a sink 
                            with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom 
                            facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>
                        <dt>What Should I bring?</dt>
                        <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan 
                            to dress for changing weather with light layers of 
                            clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight 
                            and a sense of adventure!</dd>
